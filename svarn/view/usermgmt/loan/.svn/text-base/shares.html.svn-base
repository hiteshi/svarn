<b class="loan_head">AGAINST SHARES</b>
<br>
<p class="head2">The reason to go for loans against shares or
	securities is to preserve your investment and not to mention take care
	of the personal need (could be an emergency or need of liquidity). This
	loan should however be undertaken if and only if you are expecting a
	certain sum in near future; this is only for short term need. Just in
	case you plan to invest the sum for future gains, interest, processing
	fee and other cost borne should also be considered in future profit.
	Risks should be always calculated and considered before taking.</p>
